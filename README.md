# Kadi Package Manager

Kadi is a command line tool for managing Python packages. It allows you to easily add, update, upgrade, and remove packages, as well as install all packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

To install Kadi using the install.sh script, follow these steps:
Make sure you have Git and Python with pip installed on your computer. If not, you can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads and download Python from the following URL: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Then, install pip using the following command:

```shell
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install Kadi.
Run the following command to clone the Kadi repository and install the dependencies:

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/faso-dev/main/install.sh)"
```

The `install.sh` script will clone the Kadi repository, make the kadi.sh script executable, and add it to your PATH environment variable so that it can be run from any directory.
Kadi is now installed and ready to use. You can use it with the commands described in the previous sections of this documentation.

## Usage

Kadi can be used with the following commands:

### Add a new package in your project
